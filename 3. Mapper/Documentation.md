# Objectives
- Detect cones in color images
- Reconstruct cones in image coordinates to 3D coordinates
- Have a small computational overhead and be fast
# Introduction
The environment perception is essential in any autonomous system.
The used perception sensor is a stereoscopic camera, the StereoLabs ZED 2i. Stereoscopic cameras can provide both color and depth data.
