# Mapper
The current implementation can be found in [this repository](https://github.com/FSLART/mapper_speedrun). This was a rushed implementation in Python not performance oriented and was supposed to be more thoroughly thought in the future. 
## Objectives
- Detect cones in color images
- Reconstruct cones in image coordinates to 3D coordinates
- Have a small computational overhead and be fast
